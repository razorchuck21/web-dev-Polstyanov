<h4 id="myHeader">a)In September 2014, W3C moved HTML5 to Proposed Recommendation. On 28 October 2014, HTML5 was released as a stable W3C Recommendation, meaning the specification process is complete. In 1980, physicist Tim Berners-Lee, a contractor at CERN, proposed and prototyped ENQUIRE, a system for CERN researchers to use and share documents. In 1989, Berners-Lee wrote a memo proposing an Internet-based hypertext system. Berners-Lee specified HTML and wrote the browser and server software in late 1990. That year, Berners-Lee and CERN data systems engineer Robert Cailliau collaborated on a joint request for funding, but the project was not formally adopted by CERN. In his personal notes of 1990, Berners-Lee listed "some of the many areas in which hypertext is used"; an encyclopedia is the first entry.</h4>
<h4 id="myHeader">b)In July 2012, WHATWG and W3C decided on a degree of separation. W3C will continue the HTML5 specification work, focusing on a single definitive standard, which is considered a "snapshot" by WHATWG. The WHATWG organization will continue its work with HTML5 as a "Living Standard". The concept of a living standard is that it is never complete and is always being updated and improved. New features can be added but functionality will not be removed.</h4>
<h4 id="myHeader">c)This is the minimal HTML code: <h4>
<img src="image.png" ></dt>
<h4 id="myHeader">d)Semantic HTML is the subset of HTML that describes the content and structure of a document. It introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. 
Presentational HTML is the subset of HTML used to determine the appearance of the document.</h4>
<h4 id="myHeader">e)There several things you can do, you can use online websites like W3schools, use Javascript libraries or use the Javascript code function.</h4>
<h4 id="myHeader">f) It supports MP3, AAC, and Ogg Vorbis audio formats; for video it supports MP4 WebM and Ogg. If you use the unofficial ones, then somebrowsers will try to load and play each file until they find one that works, which can take time and use unnecessary resources. If the browser cannot play any of the provided sources, it might just display a video player with nothing in it. If the type attribute isn’t included or the codec for the video type isn’t explicitly specified, the browser might fail because of the unavailable codec support.</h4>
